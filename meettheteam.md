# Meet our leadership team!

## Maggie Steiner
### Director
Maggie Steiner is a fourth year PhD Candidate in the Department of Human Genetics. Her doctoral research focuses on the development and application computational methods to study evolutionary processes in human genetics. Outside of COMBO, she serves on the Organizing Committee of Expanding Your Horizons Chicago, the Steering Committee of the UChicago Biotechnology Association, and as a Student Representative for the UChicago Medical and Biological Sciences Alumni Council.

## Marida Ianni-Ravn
### Communications Officer
Marida is a PhD candidate in Human Genetics at the University of Chicago, where she develops methods to distinguish genetic causes of traits from inherited environmental factors. Marida is passionate about making complex scientific concepts accessible to a broader audience, both through scientific illustration and by participating in outreach events. Additionally, she is having a great time mentoring at a local high school through the iMentor program.

## John Novembre, Phd
### Faculty Advisor
I got my start in this field through a combination of enjoying computer programming as a hobby and thinking about evolution as one of the worldâ€™s most fascinating natural processes. Now, my main research tackles statistical and theoretical problems to help enable discoveries about evolutionary processes and the nature of disease variation. Much of that work is in the context of human genetic variation, which is doubly fascinating because of the connections to fields like linguistics, archaeology, and history.
